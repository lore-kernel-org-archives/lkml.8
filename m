The interesting work is not done in exec.  The interesting work of
loading an executable is done in ld.so, and ld.so lives in userspace.

But we randomize where that block lives.

It has been found to be very useful to have randomization by default and
you are arguing against that kind of randomization.



Here is another suggestion.

Have a very simple program that does:

	for (;;) {
		handle = dlopen("/my/real/program");
		real_main = dlsym(handle, "main");
		real_main(argc, argv, envp);
		dlclose(handle);
	}

With whatever obvious adjustments are needed to fit your usecase.

That should give the same level of functionality, be portable to all
unices, and not require you to duplicate code.  It belive it limits you
to not upgrading libc, or librt but that is a comparatively small
limitation.


Given that in general the interesting work is done in userspace and that
userspace has provided an interface for reusing that work already.
I don't see the justification for adding anything to exec at this point.
