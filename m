So I got a little bit of time to look at this before I got pulled off
to other things (and now its Friday night, so I figured I'd reply
before I forget it on Monday).

I did check and lockdep is tripping when we add ttyAMA6 which is the
serial console on the board. I wasn't able to trace back to why we
hadn't already called spin_lock_init() in the console code, but it
seems we haven't.

Also I checked on HiKey as well, and there I'm seeing the same lockdep
splat and this fix seems to resolve it. So more digging is needed. If
anyone has a better idea of what might be awry or if the lock does
need to be initialized in the driver (it's a bit inconsistent, I see
some drivers do but others don't), let me know.

thanks
