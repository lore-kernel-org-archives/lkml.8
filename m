I dont mind having it, in fact I found really old email where I'm
asking Peter about that ;-) and he wasn't very keen about that:
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1312806326.10488.30.camel@twins/

not sure what was the actual reason at that time and if anything
changed since.. Peter?

btw I can't apply even that v2 on latest Arnaldo's branch
