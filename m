It does not matter for older kernels because there is exactly one user.
That one user is just a place holder keeping the code alive until a real
user comes along.

For older kernels the solution is to just mark the bpfilter code broken
in Kconfig and refuse to compile it.  That is the trivial backportable
fix if anyone wants one.
