If the write is successful (ie. no errors returned and the value
returned is equal to the number of written characters), the kernel
*has* accepted the written value, but it may not have taken effect.
These are two different things.

The written value may take an effect immediately or it may take an
effect later, depending on the current configuration etc.  If you
don't see the effect of it immediately, it doesn't matter that there
was a failure of some sort.

Why do you want it to fail then?

Because when you change the scaling algorithm or the driver's
operation mode, the value you have written will take effect.

In this particular case it is explained in the driver documentation
that the performance scaling algorithm in the active mode overrides
the sysfs value and that's the only case when it can be overridden.
So whatever you write to this attribute will not take effect
immediately anyway, but it may take an effect later.

An alternative is to fail writes to energy_performance_preference if
the driver works in the active mode and the scaling algorithm for the
scaling CPU is performance and *then* to make reads from it return the
value in the register.

Accepting a write and returning a different value in a subsequent read
is confusing.

Thanks!
