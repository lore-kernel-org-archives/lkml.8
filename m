Which is perfectly fine.

Which is not a problem as long as the thread finishes before 100k MSIs
arrived on that line. If that happens then there is something really
wrong. Either the device fires MSIs like crazy or the threaded handler
is stuck somewhere.

What's wrong with having another interrupt firing while the threaded
handler is running? Nothing, really. It actually can be desired because
the threaded handler is allowed to sleep.
