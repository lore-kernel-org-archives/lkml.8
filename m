Yes.  system_freezing_cnt as an enable/disable that affects all
tasks in the system does seem like a misfeature for use in the context
of exec where only a few tasks need to be dealt with.

Hmm.  Potentially.  The synchronization with the other threads must
happen in a multi-threaded exec in de_thread.

So I need to look at the differences between where de_thread thread
can kill a thread and the freezer can not freeze a thread.  I am hoping
that the freezer has already instrumented most of those sleeps but I
admit I have not looked yet.

Very true.  I absolutely missed that detail.

Perhaps even a single bit.

The code that is controlled by CONFIG_FREEZER is just kernel/freezer.c,
and include/linux/freezer.h.  Which is 177 + 303 lines respectively
so not much.

Or are you thinking about all of the locations that already include
freezable sleeps?

To catch things in the scheduler I presume?

The thing is the freezer code does not wake up anything if it is in a
sleep that it has wrapped.  Which I thought was just about all
significant ones but I need to verify that.

Yes.  Where we catch things seems to be key.  I believe if all sleeps
that are killable plus system call exit should be enough, to be a noop.
As those are the places where the code can be killed now.

The tricky part is to mark processes that are sleeping in such a way
that then they wake up they go into a slow path and they get trapped
by the freezing code.

Part of my challenge is that it the more layers that get put around a
sleep the trickier it is to subsequently wrap.

I can see the point of building something very simple and more
fundamental that doesn't need as much support as the current freezer.
Perhaps something the freezer can the be rebuilt upon.


If the basic idea of stopping other threads early before we kill them in
exec sounds plausible then I will see what I can do.
