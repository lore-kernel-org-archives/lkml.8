My initial question was why doesn't io-boosting fix this up, but a quick
look at our pipe code shows me that it doesn't seem to use
io_schedule().

That is currently our only means to express 'someone is waiting on us'
to which we then say 'lets hurry up a bit'.

Because, as you've found, if the tasks do not queue up, there is nothing
to push the frequency up.
