Yes!

Documentation/ seems like the obvious place. Possibly also somewhere on
wiki.kernel.org or elsewhere so that people can contribute information
without having to submit a formal patch.

Your list above is pretty good.

For features that relate to specific hardware I think it would be useful
to have some more information.

For example when the hardware was last manufactured, who made it, how
could it be purchased when it was available (eg. was it for sale to the
public or in limited quantities or only to certain people or internal to
a particular company).

I think it can make sense at many levels. It probably just depends on
how much effort folks want to go to in order to track down the
information.

Looking at powerpc it would be useful to have that sort of info for
individual boards, as well as each platform, CPU families and specific
drivers.

cheers
