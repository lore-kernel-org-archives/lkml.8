How nice.  According to your lspci, the device itself claims to
support ASPM:

  02:00.0 ... ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1083/1085 PCIe to PCI Bridge
    LnkCap: ... ASPM L0s L1 ...

but the web page claims otherwise.  That would mean the device is
defective for claiming something that's not true.  Or possibly those
capability bits can be set by BIOS.

If Windows *does* manage to enable ASPM, that would be interesting.  I
don't know whether Windows has a similar quirk mechanism.  I suppose
they must have *some* way to work around defective devices.
