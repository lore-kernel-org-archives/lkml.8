(Hm, how did I not get that message? Weird. :))

I hope we won't be able to receive fds through read(). This quickly
becomes quite problematic, I think.

Right, and recvmsg() is quite dangerous because of that because you need
to be extremely careful when e.g. the message is truncated and you want
to error out and you need to carefully close all fds and other shenanigans.

Also, recvmsg() imho, is a bit different from read simply because
it's sort-of a "typed" read; it's plumbed on top of a message protocol and
that protocal includes the ability to read fds. read() on the other hand
is completely agnostic and doesn't care about the data at all. But
that's just how I always conceptualized it...
