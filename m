I saw that was possible.  If the broad strokes look correct I don't have
a problem at all with optimizing for the case where many of the entries
are for inodes on the same superblock.  I just had enough other details
on my mind I was afraid if I got a little more clever I would have
introduced a typo somewhere.


I wish I could limit the sysctl parts to just directories, but
unfortunately the sysctl tables don't always give a guarantee that a
directory is what will be removed.  But sysctls do have one name per
inode invarant like fat.  There is no way to express a sysctl
table that doesn't have that invariant.

As for d_find_alias/d_invalidate.

Just for completeness I wanted to write a loop:

	while (dentry = d_find_alias(inode)) {
        	d_invalidate(dentry);
                dput(dentry);
        }

Unfortunately that breaks on directories, because for directories
d_find_alias turns into d_find_any_alias, and continues to return aliases
even when they are unhashed.

It might be nice to write a cousin of d_prune_aliases call
it d_invalidate_aliases that just does that loop the correct way
in dcache.c
