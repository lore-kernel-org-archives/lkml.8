Yes.  I understand that.

I occassionally play with ideas, and converted all of proc to rcu
to help with situation but I haven't come up with anything clearly
better.


All of this is why I was really hoping we could have a change in
strategy and see if we can make the shrinker be able to better prune
proc inodes.



I think I have an alternate idea that could work.  Add some extra code
into proc_task_readdir, that would look for dentries that no longer
point to tasks and d_invalidate them.  With the same logic probably
being called from a few more places as well like proc_pid_readdir,
proc_task_lookup, and proc_pid_lookup.

We could even optimize it and have a process died flag we set in the
superblock.

That would would batch up the freeing work until the next time someone
reads from proc in a way that would create more dentries.  So it would
prevent dentries from reaped zombies from growing without bound.

Hmm.  Given the existence of proc_fill_cache it would really be a good
idea if readdir and lookup performed some of the freeing work as well.
As on readdir we always populate the dcache for all of the directory
entries.

I am booked solid for the next little while but if no one beats me to it
I will try and code something like that up where at least readdir
looks for and invalidates stale dentries.
