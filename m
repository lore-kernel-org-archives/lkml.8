But does the caller handle the -EOPNOTSUPP properly?  I think right now
it will just fail the large registration that worked before this patchset.

Given that ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN is only true for alpha, parisc and a few
arm subarchitectures I think just not supporting umem is probably
cleared.  And eventually we'll need to drop ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN entirely.
