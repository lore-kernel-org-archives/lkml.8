From past experiences with other syscalls I would expect that any new
features would only be available through openat2().
The way I see it in general is that a revised version of a syscall
basically deprecates the old syscall _wrt to new features_, i.e. new
features will only be available through the revised version unless there
are very strong reasons to also allow it in the old version (security
bug or whatever).
(But I don't want to be presumptuous here and pretend I can make any
definiteve statement. Ultimately it's up to the community, I guess. :))
