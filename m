This patch is against linux-next, which is ahead of both
linux-block and mainline tree.  Here's the interlinkage:

https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next/+/4d4901c6d748efab8aab6e7d2405dadaed0bea50](javascript:;)

or you can find the commit <4d4901c6d7> which changes seq_read to 
seq_read_iter with the -next tag, in fact, it's just a simple script:

sed -i -e 's/\.read\(\s*=\s*\)seq_read/\.read_iter\1seq_read_iter/g'

By the way, there won't be needless confict because seq_read in both
file and macro are switched to seq_read_iter together.

That looks good to me. Let me know if patch based on 5.8rc is needed.

Thanks.
