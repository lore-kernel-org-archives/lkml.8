To clarify it a bit: the effects of calling conventions change are mostly due
to not passing (and saving) those error pointers, and that could be had with
"pass the initial sum in" - just start these iov_iter.c loops with sum = ~0U
and we get the same warranties re not getting 0 in absence of faults.

The point is, your "~4.5 cycles per vector" is pretty much noise and the
difference between the 3-argument and 4-argument variants could easily be
in the same range.  It might be a valid microoptimization, it might be not.
3-argument variant is simpler and IMO in absence of strong data we ought
to go with that.
