Yes.

The tricky bit is that there are a handful of stops that must
be handled, or it is impossible to stop everything without causing
disruption if the exec fails.  The big ones are TASK_STOPPED and
TASK_TRACED.  There is another in wait_for_vfork_done.

At which point I am looking at writting a wrapper around schedule that
changes task state to something like TASK_WAKEKILL when asked, and then
restores the state when released.  Something that is independent of
which freezer the code is using.

It could be the scheduler to with a special bit in state that says
opt-in.  But if we have to opt in it is probably much less error
prone to write the code as an wrapper around schedule, and only
modify the core scheduling code if necessary.

If I can make TASK_STOPPED and TASK_TRACED handle spurious wake-ups
I think I can build something that is independent of the rest of the
freezers so the code doesn't have to go 3 deep on wrappers of different
freezer at those locations.  It is already 2 layers deep.

But I really don't intend to work on that again for a while.


Right now I am in the final stages of ressurecting:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/87a7ohs5ow.fsf@xmission.com/

The hard part looks like cleaning up and resurrecting Oleg's patch
to prevent the abuse of files_struct->count.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20180915160423.GA31461@redhat.com/

I am close but dotting all of the i's and crossing all of the t's is
taking ab bit.
