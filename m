One alternative would be to add a helper to compute the effective size on c++, e.g.:

/* Always updated with struct rseq_cs declaration.  */
#define rseq_last_field kernel_size

static inline size_t rseq_effective_size(void)
{
    return offsetof(struct rseq, rseq_last_field) + sizeof(((struct rseq *)NULL)->rseq_last_field);
}

The alignment will never decrease. If the structure becomes large enough
its alignment could theoretically increase. Would that be an issue ?

Can the size and alignment of a structure be defined as minimum alignment
and size values ? For instance, those would be invariant for a given glibc
version (if we always use the internal struct rseq declaration), but could
be increased in future versions.

Do you mean with a function "getter", and then keeping that pointer around
in a per-user TLS ? I would prefer to avoid that because it adds an extra
pointer dereference on a fast path.

I did propose the code to do just that in my initial rseq implementations, but
the idea was shutdown by kernel maintainers because it required the kernel to
handle a linked-list of rseq areas per thread, which was more complex within
the kernel.
