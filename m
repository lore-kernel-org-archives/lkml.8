Absolutely agreed! It is not really hard to see system struggling due to
heavy FS metadata workload while there are objects which could be
reclaimed.

Yes, we have discussed something like that few years back at LSFMM IIRC.
The scoped NOFS/NOIO api was just a first step to reduce explicit
NOFS/NOIO usage with a hope that we will get no-recursion entry points
much more well defined and get rid of many instances where "this is a fs
code so it has to use NOFS gfp mask".

Some of that has happened and that is really great. On the other hand
many people still like to use that api as a workaround for an immediate
problem because no-recursion scopes are much harder to recognize unless
you are supper familiar with the specific fs/IO layer implementation.
So this is definitely not a project for somebody to go over all code and
just do the clean up.

Thanks!
