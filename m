Well, I just copied the call chain. I had no way to know you were the
one who discovered the bug given the way it was presented to me. And the
original patch didn't include much in the way of analysis of the bug,
just "It's Racy".

I didn't deliberately omit the link, it just never occurred to me to add
it. In retrospect, I should have included it, sorry about that.

Yes, that's an improvement.

Thanks.

I'd suggest simply rebasing the completion patch on this patch, or a
patch like it. Then we'll have the proper bug fix commit and there won't
be a conflict.
