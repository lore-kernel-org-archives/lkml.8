Subject: [PATCH] PM: runtime: Improve kerneldoc of pm_runtime_get_if_active()
Date:   Fri, 31 Jul 2020 19:04:11 +0200
Message-ID: <3777183.7rZhd9hnLu@kreacher>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7Bit

Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rafael.j.wysocki@intel.com>

The kerneldoc comment of pm_runtime_get_if_active() doesn't list the
second argument of the function properly, so fix that and while at it
clarify that comment somewhat and add some markup to it.
