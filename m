In other words, wakeup events are supposed to be reported at the time 
the wakeup request is first noticed, right?  We don't want to wait until 
a resume or runtime_resume callback runs; thanks to this race the 
callback might not run at all if the event isn't reported first.

Therefore the reasoning behind the original code appears to have been 
highly suspect.  If there already was a queued runtime-resume request 
for the device and the device was wakeup-enabled, the wakeup event 
should _already_ have been reported at the time the request was queued.  
And we shouldn't rely on it being reported by the runtime-resume 
callback routine.

Okay, we'll see!
