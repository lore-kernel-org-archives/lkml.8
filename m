Where this initially came from was I was looking at how to clean up the
case of no_new_privs/ptrace of a suid executable when we don't have
enough permissions.   Just being able to create creds that kept
everything as they were looked very useful and there was just this one
little bit missing.

I included the change to prepare_exec_creds in this patchset to
emphasize that neither security_bprm_creds_for_exec nor
security_bprm_repopulate_creds need to do anything if there is nothing
special going on.

At the very least that helps me think through what the LSMs are required
to do, and what those hooks are for.  AKA privilege changing execs.

So I was thinking rely on the LSMs as little as possible rather than
rely on the binfmt handlers as little as possible.  But it is the same
idea.

And yes it makes everything easier to analyze if everything starts off
in a known good state.
