As far as I can tell, it doesn't actually make a difference as
all the compilers produce the same object code with either form.

There may be some compiler warning by clang through.

Does any version of gcc produce a warning on 

	struct foo {
		...
		type bar[0];
	};

but not

	struct foo {
		...
		type bar[];
	};
