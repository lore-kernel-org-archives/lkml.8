Again, that depends on your POV. It's a perfectly valid scenario to have
another HW irq coming in preventing the thread to go to sleep and just
run for another cycle. So no, masking is not necessarily required and
the semantics of MSI is edge type, so the hardware should not fire
another interrupt _before_ the threaded handler actually took care of
the initial one.

This is completely irrelevant. The primary hardware IRQ handler is
provided by the core code in this case.

Due to the semantics of MSI this is perfectly fine and aside of your
problem this has worked perfectly fine so far and it's an actual
performance win because it avoid fiddling with the MSI mask which is
slow.

You still have not told which driver/hardware is affected by this. Can
you please provide that information so we can finally look at the actual
hardware/driver combo?

Either the driver is broken or the hardware does not comply with the MSI
spec.

Thanks,
