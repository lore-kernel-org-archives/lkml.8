Yes.  That is definitely a concern.

I am thinking about looking in proc/<pid>/fd and maybe opening those
files.  That access is gated by ptrace_may_access which is gated
by the process credentials. So I know strictly speaking it is wrong.

I think you are correct that it would only allow access to a file that
could be accessed another way.  Even execveat at a quick glance appears
to go through the orinary permission checks of open.

The current code is definitely a maintenance pitfall as it install state
into the process early.

I meant generically installing the fd not universally installing it.

I don't think leaving the install in binfmt_misc is responsible at this
point.
