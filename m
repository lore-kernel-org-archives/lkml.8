The comments for an LSM writer are in include/linux/lsm_hooks.h

 * @bprm_repopulate_creds:
 *	Assuming that the relevant bits of @bprm->cred->security have been
 *	previously set, examine @bprm->file and regenerate them.  This is
 *	so that the credentials derived from the interpreter the code is
 *	actually going to run are used rather than credentials derived
 *	from a script.  This done because the interpreter binary needs to
 *	reopen script, and may end up opening something completely different.
 *	This hook may also optionally check permissions (e.g. for
 *	transitions between security domains).
 *	The hook must set @bprm->active_secureexec to 1 if AT_SECURE should be set to
 *	request libc enable secure mode.
 *	@bprm contains the linux_binprm structure.
 *	Return 0 if the hook is successful and permission is granted.

I hope that is detailed enough.

I will leave the rest of the comments for the maintainer of the code.

I really don't think we should duplicate the prescriptive comments in
multiple locations.
