I agree with David here.  The ioctls are currently doing what could have
been done nicely with a userspace library.  Moving away from the string
based internal interface is a good move to my mind, because it ensures
consistency in they sysfs interface and provides for in kernel users
when they make sense.  The step of then using that to simplify providing
an IOCTL interface to do the same things doesn't seem particularly useful.
So what do we gain?
