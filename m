I am conflicted about that but I have to agree.    Instead of
duplicating everything it would be good enough to duplicate the once
that cause the process to be attached to use.  Then there would be no
more pid races to worry about.

How does this differ using the tracing related infrastructure we have
for the kernel on a userspace process?  I suspect augmenting the tracing
infrastructure with the ability to set breakpoints and watchpoints (aka
stopping userspace threads and processes might be a more fertile
direction to go).

But I agree either we want to just address the races in PTRACE_ATTACH
and PTRACE_SIEZE or we want to take a good hard look at things.

There is a good case for minimal changes because one of the cases that
comes up is how much work will it take to change existing programs.  But
ultimately ptrace pretty much sucks so a very good set of test cases and
documentation for what we want to implement would be a very good idea.
