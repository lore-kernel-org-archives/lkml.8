As you pointed out that this is not on MSI-X I'm considering the torn
write theory to be more likely. :)

No. I tried the patch myself to verify that it does what I want.

The only information I'm missing right now is the interrupt number to
look for. But I'll stare at it with brain awake tomorrow morning again.

That's what I expected. The main difference is that the vector
modification happens at a point where a device is not supposed to send
an interrupt. They happen when the interrupt of the device is serviced
before the driver handler is invoked and at that point the device should
not send another one.

Right, I wanted to ask you that as well and forgot. With interrupt
remapping the migration happens at the remapping unit which does not
have the horrible 'move it while servicing' requirement and it suppports
proper masking.

Thanks,
