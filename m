Take a look at the code.  At the end of the day nstype is not treated at
all like a flags field.

It isn't a very important point.  And it was certainly easier to use
the existing bits for essentially their existing meanings.  But it was
certainly something I was thinking at the time.

I think I left it as we can see either way, depending on how things
evolve.

I can imagine a use for a nstype being a single namespace from a pidfd.
Do you have any actual usecases for setting some but not all of the
namespaces from a pidfd?  If we don't have a compelling reason
I would like to kick that can down the road a ways farther.

I am also remembering that that setns freed the low 8 bits.  Which gave
some freedom beyond clone.

I am suggesting that when we do:

"setns(pidfd, 0)" or "setns(pidfd, SETNS_PIDFD)"

That the result is not just the namespaces changing but also the root
directory changing to the pids root directory.  Something where the
whole is greater than the parts.
