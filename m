Yes.  That will make a very nice change to the patch.

I think I will go with bprm->clear_unsafe_personality_bits or
something to that effect. 

I would really love to have a bit that means creds_changes or
privilegeds_elevated.  But right now we have 2 of two fields that mean
essentially that (per_clear and secureexec) and they don't agree on when
they get set.

I will make them agree as much as possible, and this patchset is a first
step in that direction but until we can actually make them agree, I want
to keep them both grounded in what they do.  That way it is possible to
have a reasonable discussion on when they should be set.

Eric
