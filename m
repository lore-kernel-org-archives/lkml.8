Hi everyone,

I=E2=80=99m also hitting this bug with games that use force-feedback =
steering wheels under Wine/Proton. It typically shows up as EVIOCSFF =
ioctls failing with EINVAL, since all the effects were unexpectedly =
flushed.

The problem is that input_ff_flush() is called whenever a file =
descriptor is closed, but there can be multiple descriptors open to the =
same file description (through fork(), dup(), etc). input_ff_flush() =
removes all effects added by that file description, which the users of =
the other descriptors certainly don't expect.

As for the fix, maybe fd_ops->flush() shouldn=E2=80=99t be implemented =
at all?
In the current design, effects =E2=80=9Cbelong=E2=80=9D to a file =
description (a struct file *), not a descriptor. This seems sensible to =
me: a process could open a device, upload an effect, then fork(), and it =
makes sense that the child would have full control of the effects =
created by the parent. It seems to me like nothing should be done when a =
descriptor is closed, and input_ff_flush() should be called only when =
the whole struct file is released.

I=E2=80=99ve attached a modified copy of Mathieu=E2=80=99s code, which =
reproduces the problem for me with a Logitech G25 steering wheel.
