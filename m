Yecchh...  First of all, you are leaving a dangling pointer in your
struct pstore_private ->dentry.  What's more, in your case d_delete()
is definitely wrong - either there are other references to dentry
(in which case d_delete() is the same as d_drop()), or dput() right
after it will drive ->d_count to zero and since you end up using
simple_dentry_operations, dentry will be freed immediately after
that.

I have not looked at the locking in that series yet, so no comments
on the races, but in any case - that d_delete() is a misspelled d_drop().
