Why should the kernel command line implement userspace whims?
I was thinking something like: "sysctl/kernel/max_lock_depth=2048"
doesn't look too bad and it makes things like reusing our
kernel internal helpers much easier.

Plus it suggest that we could do the same for sysfs files:
	"sysfs/kernel/fscaps=1"

And the code could be same for both cases except for the filesystem
prefix.

I would argue that reusing proc_sysctl.c:lookup_entry() should make the
code simpler, and easier to reason about.

Especially given the bugs in the first version with a sysctl path.
A clean separation between separating the path from into pieces and
looking up those pieces should make the code more robust.

That plus I want to get very far away from the incorrect idea that you
can have sysctls without compiling in proc support.  That is not how
the code works, that is not how the code is tested.

It is also worth pointing out that:

	proc_mnt = kern_mount(proc_fs_type);
        for_each_sysctl_cmdline() {
        	...
		file = file_open_root(proc_mnt->mnt_root, proc_mnt, sysctl_path, O_WRONLY, 0);
		kernel_write(file, value, value_len);
        }
        kern_umount(proc_mnt);

Is not an unreasonable implementation.

There are problems with a persistent mount of proc in that it forces
userspace not to use any proc mount options.  But a temporary mount of
proc to deal with command line options is not at all unreasonable.
Plus it looks like we can have kern_write do all of the kernel/user
buffer silliness.
