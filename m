Very good point.  That would be a priority inversion on mmap_lock.
Without great care that could indeed result in lockups.

That definitely requires the points where things are already sleeping
that can be converted to be opt-in.  Which potentially makes things much
more work.

Thanks, that helps kill my bright idea as I expressed it.

Part of what I was trying to solve (because I ran into the problem while
I was reading the code) was that the freezer, the cgroup v2 freezer, and
other waits do not compose nicely.

Even limited to opt-in locations I think the trick of being able to
transform the wait-state may solve that composition problem.


That said I was really just posting this so if the ideas were good they
could inspire future code, and if the ideas were bad they could be sunk.
When it comes to sorting out future especially in exec I will know which
ideas don't fly, so it will be easier to make the case for ideas that
will work.
