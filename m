Thanks for your response! My worries is that, for example:

We read page 0, and trigger readahead to read n pages(0 - n-1). While in 
another thread, we read page n-1.

In the current implementation, if readahead is in the process of reading
page 0 - n-2,  later operation doesn't need to wait the former one to 
finish. However, later operation will have to wait if we add all pages
to page cache first. And that is why I said it might cause problem for
performance overhead.

Yes, it's not a problem in your implementation.

Thanks!
