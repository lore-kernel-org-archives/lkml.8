I think this series should drop the "late" checks in fs/exec.c  It feels
less error prone, and it feels like that would transform this into
something Linus would be eager to merge because series becomes a cleanup
that reduces line count.

I haven't been inside of open recently enough to remember if the
location you are putting the check fundamentally makes sense.  But the
O_MAYEXEC bits make a pretty strong case that something of the sort
needs to happen.

I took a quick look but I can not see clearly where path_noexec
and the regular file tests should go.

I do see that you have code duplication with faccessat which suggests
that you haven't put the checks in the right place.

I am wondering if we need something distinct to request the type of the
file being opened versus execute permissions.

All I know is being careful and putting the tests in a good logical
place makes the code more maintainable, whereas not being careful
results in all kinds of sharp corners that might be exploitable.
So I think it is worth digging in and figuring out where those checks
should live.  Especially so that code like faccessat does not need
to duplicate them.
