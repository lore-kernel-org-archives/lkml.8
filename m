Ok, I will resend this patch disabling freq invariant accounting when this
overflow happens.

To elaborate further, your comment touches on an area where x86 freq
invariance is very weak at the moment: what happens if the tick doesn't run on
a cpu for a long time (answer: the estimation of freq_scale is garbage).
And by "a long time" I mean a few seconds; the patch I'm about to resend only
covers a minuscule fraction of those cases. That is, not only the tick has
been missing for days (?!), but we only noticed because the product
mcnt * arch_max_freq_ratio gave exactly 2^64 (aka 0). It could have been
waiting for 1 more millis and we wouldn't have seen the issue.

Anyways I agree on the principle: even if we can't address all problems now,
let's at least cover those where the solution is easy.
