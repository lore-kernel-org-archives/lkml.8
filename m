Wanting to bother with d_inode is a bit strong.

It was just a matter of the helper function proc_pid_ns was built to
work against inodes.  And working with inodes looks reasonable as
in all of the places in proc where it was originally called it had
an inode, and did not have a dentry.

I don't think there was any strong design to it.

Before changing the s_fs_info in proc we found Tomoyo accessing it
without any helpers, and used the helper we had.  Which looked
reasonable.  Now we have discovered it wasn't.

It probably makes most sense just to have the helper go from the
super_block, and not worry about inodes or dentries.

Alexey Gladkov is already looking at fixing this.
