Ok, I now understand this point. That's exceedingly subtle.

I certainly would not agree that this qualifies as "seriously broken",
and I'm not even sure I'd agree that this actually violates the
semantics of poll() seeing the man page clearly states that with
EPOLLEXCLUSIVE set, "one or more" pollers will be woken up. So waking up
all of them is still allowed. Ensuring fewer pollers wake up is just an
optimization to avoid the thundering herd problem which users of this
interface are very unlikely to ever have (I can confidently tell you
that none have this problem now).

If we do want to say that all poll_wait() users *must* respect
EPOLLEXCLUSIVE, we should at least have some documentation saying that
combining poll_wait() with wake_up_all() (or similar) is not allowed. A
*very* quick check finds there's at least a few drivers doing this:

  drivers/char/ipmi/ipmb_dev_int.c
  drivers/dma-buf/sync_file.c
  drivers/gpu/vga/vgaarb.c

(That's just looking at the drivers tree, up to "G".)

Finally, since we seem to back to more reasonable discussion, I will
make this point: it's fairly common for wait queue users to directly use
the spinlock from within wait_queue_head_t without an interface (even
completion.c does it). How are developers supposed to know when an
interface is required and when it's not? Sometimes using
"implementation" details interface-free is standard practice, but other
times it's "yuck" and will illicit ire from other developers? Is it
valid to use completion.wait.lock? Where's the line?
