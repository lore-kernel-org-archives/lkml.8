Yes, that would be easier then but it seems like a much larger change
because currently bdi is disassociated from request_queue only in
__blk_release_queue() (blk_exit_queue()). I guess the separate bdi
registration / deregistration is partially a leftover from times when bdi
was still embedded in request_queue but now it's difficult to undo it.
