NP. We thought pipeline is generic hw term so we proposed "pipeline"
word. We are open to term which can be generic enough.

Yes. we should capture core pipeline specific details. For example,
IBS generates Branch unit information(IbsOpData1) and Icahce related
data(IbsFetchCtl) which is something that shouldn't be extended as
part of perf-mem, IMO.

Yes. We will include fields to capture the latency cycles (like Issue
latency, Instruction completion latency etc..) along with other pipeline
details in the proposed structure.

We took a look at PERF_SAMPLE_AUX. IIUC, PERF_SAMPLE_AUX is intended when
large volume of data needs to be captured as part of perf.data without
frequent PMIs. But proposed type is to address the capture of pipeline
information on each sample using PMI at periodic intervals. Hence proposing
PERF_SAMPLE_PIPELINE_HAZ.

When AUX buffer data is structured, tool side changes added to present the
pipeline data can be re-used.
