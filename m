Note that this has been previously reported in:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208251
and confirmed by several people on various stable series and the mainline that
the referenced commit is indeed causing the problem.

I don't get the "device descriptor read" errors though, my dmesg is posted on
the bug report, it just says "ath9k_htc: Failed to initialize the device".
