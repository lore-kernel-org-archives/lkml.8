That plus it is very much true that active_ isn't a particularly good
prefix.  pf_ for per_file seems slightly better.

The only time I can imagine this patch seeing the light of day is if
someone happens to discover that this fixes a bug for them and just this
patch is backported.  At which point pf_per_clear pairs with
cap_elevated.  So I don't think it hurts.

*Shrug*

The next patch is my long term solution to the mess.

I think you have more skill at writing automated tests than I do.  So
feel free to write some.
