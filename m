So it is a good point that container runtimes use Go, and that
fundamentally anything that uses Go will be multi-threaded.  Having just
looked closely at this I don't think in practice this is an issue even
at this early state of my code.

If those other threads are sleeping the code I have implemented should
be a no-op.

If those threads aren't sleeping you have undefined behavior, as at
some point the kernel will come through and kill those threads.

Further unless I am completely mistaken the container runtimes use
forkAndExecInChild from go/src/syscall/exec_linux.go which performs a
vfork before performing the exec.
