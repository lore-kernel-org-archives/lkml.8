So the patch you mention deals with test_bit(), which is out of the scope
of smp_mb__{before,after}_atomic() as it's not a RMW operation. atomic_inc()
and set_bit() are, however, meant to use these barriers.

Yeah, I struggled with the amount of undocumented barriers, and decided
not to go down that rabbit hole. This patch is only an equivalent of
what is currently there. When possible, getting rid of barriers is of
course better.
