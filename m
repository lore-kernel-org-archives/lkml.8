The above is a benefit, but leading off with it suggests that this
change is specifically for that config, which it isn't.

s/needs to be in that case/needs to be disabled in that case/ ?

If this is a regression, that means it used to work correctly.  So are
you saying 7d715a6c1ae5^ works correctly?  That seems doubtful since
7d715a6c1ae5 appeared in v2.6.26 and added ASPM support in the first
place.

I agree, that comment is missing the essential information about *why*
we don't do ASPM.

But this comment just perpetuates it and makes the special case even
more special.  I think we should either remove that special case
completely or figure out what the real issue is.

I know we weren't always very good about computing the acceptable
latencies (and we still don't handle LTR correctly, though that's an
L1 Substates issue that wouldn't have applied in the 7d715a6c1ae5
timeframe).
