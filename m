The code reads like you had several ideas for how the uptodate array
works, changing your mind as you went along, and it didn't quite get to
a coherent state before it was merged.  For example, there are parts
of the code which think that a clear bit in the uptodate array means
there's a hole in the file, eg

fs/iomap/seek.c:page_seek_hole_data() calls iomap_is_partially_uptodate()

but we set the uptodate bits when zeroing the parts of the page which
are covered by holes in iomap_readpage_actor()

Hah, I want to do that too, and I was afraid I was going to have to
argue with you about it!

My thinking was to skip the allocation if the page lies entirely within
an iomap extent.  That will let us skip the allocation even for THPs
unless the file is fragmented.

I don't think it needs to get done before THP support, they're pretty
orthogonal.
