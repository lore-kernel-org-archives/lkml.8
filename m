In general config options for this are a really bad idea because if the
tools only cope with one setting, no-one should ever use the other and
if they work with everything there's no need for the option.

seems like the answer to this one would be don't queue.  I realise it's
after the submit design, but what about measuring when the key is added
if there's a policy otherwise measure the keyring when the policy is
added ... that way no queueing.

I'm just giving the general rule of thumb for boolean config options. 
If it's default Y there likely shouldn't be a config option and if it's
default N the feature should likely not be in the kernel at all.
