Yeah, and maybe SB_USERNS_FSID_EXEMPT ?

The only place that would be a problem is if the child userns has an
fsidmapping from X to 0 in the parent userns, right?  Yeah I'm sure
many people would ignore all advice to the contrary and do this anyway,
but I would try hard to suggest that people use an intermediary userns
for storing filesystems for the "docker share" case.  So the host fsid
range would start at say 200000.  So a setuid binary would just be
setuid-200000.
