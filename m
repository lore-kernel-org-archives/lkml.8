Fair enough.  We'll carry on doing it with devm_add_action_or_reset
which forces us to take a close look at why we always want the lifetime
to match that of the device.

Note the key thing here is we don't have a remove in these drivers.
Everything is managed.  Mixing and matching between managed and unmanaged
causes more subtle race conditions...
