Yes.  It seems actually mapping it to userspace in media/drm drivers
seems to be one of the big use cases.  There other one is memory not
used by the host at all and just as an extra buffer for hardware so
that the PCIe device can cut down on DRAM cost.  For that could
potentially skip the zeroing, but then again you'd need to trust the
device, which with thunderbolt might not always be a good idea.
