I think there is a very good argument that no one builds libraries
usable with uselib anymore.  The ELF version requires a ET_EXEC binary
with one PT_LOAD segment that is loaded at a fixed virtual address.
This is a format that does not allow for relocation processing, the
loading executable has to ``know'' where the symbols are in the loaded
binary, and they have to be build to run at distinct virtual addresses.

I think I could conjure up some linker scripts to do that with no more
linker support than we use to build the kernel, but it is not easy to
maintain binaries and libraries like that as code changes.  Which is
why we switched to ELF in the first place.

I think the tooling challenges plus not being able to find anything
using uselib anymore make a solid argument for going to a distribution
and asking them to stop enabling CONFIG_USELIB in their kernels.
