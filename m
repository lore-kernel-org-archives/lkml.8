Alright I have looked at the freezer a bit more and I now see that the
point of marking things freezable is for kernel threads rather that user
space threads.  I think there are 5 maybe 6 places the code sleeps
reachable by userspace threads that are marked as freezable and most
of those are callable from get_signal.

For exec all I care about are user space threads.  So it appears the
freezer infrastructure adds very little.

Now to see if I can find another way to divert a task into a slow path
as it wakes up, so I don't need to manually wrap all of the sleeping
calls.  Something that plays nice with the scheduler.

Eric
