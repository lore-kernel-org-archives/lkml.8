Who's call is that? If the patch had said "From: Martin K. Petersen" and 
"This driver is being removed because it has the following defects..." 
that would be some indication of a good-faith willingness to accept users 
as developers in the spirit of the GPL, which is what you seem to be 
alluding to (?).
