OK yes we don't have much of a charger detection currently and the
charger tries to reconnect with the LED blinking rapidly with an
empty battery.

OK, sounds like that should work :) 

I still need to figure update audio notifications for the current set of
gsmmux patches. Eventually maybe ofono can just set the voice call audio
routing using alsa. But let's get the kernel notifications working first
as we also need to fix up the audio parts for the earlier comments from
Peter and Sebastian.

Tony
