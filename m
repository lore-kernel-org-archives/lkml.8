These are not KERN_<LEVEL> at all, all are emitted at KERN_DEBUG

These are just driver developer mechanisms to enable/disable
groups of formats via some test for < level or | bitmap

Not possible.

Or maybe a u32/ulong worth as most as I think the largest
current use is 32 bits of bitmask.

Adapting that with an external bool for bitmask or class
would work fine.

	if (is_bitmask)
		enable/disable(value|flag)
	else
		enable/disable(value < flag)

So the equivalent of logical sets would work just fine.
