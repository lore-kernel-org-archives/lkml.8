Good points.

OK

So AFAIU we would have glibc expose a symbol, e.g.:

off_t rseq_tls_offset(void);

Which would be typically called by user libraries and applications at initialization
to get the offset of the struct rseq. They should store it in a static variable so
rseq critical sections can use that offset.

Is there an arch-agnostic way to get the thread pointer from user-space code ? That
would be needed by all rseq critical section implementations.

Thanks,

Mathieu
