Ok, great!

xarrays weren't around when this code was written (back in the 2.5
days).

It does?  Where does that happen?  I see a bunch of kobject_init()
calls, but nothing that registers it in sysfs that I can see.

Note, this is not the kobject that shows up in /sys/dev/char/ as a
symlink, that comes from the driver core logic and is independent of the
cdev code.

The kobject does handle the structure lifetime rules, but that should be
able to be replaced with a simple kref instead.

Fair enough, I will be willing to tackle that once this gets merged, so
this is fine as-is.
